# Enhanced Project Plan: Genetic-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning AI for Super Mario Bros

## Project Objectives

1.  **Objective 1** (Completed in AP1): To utilize reinforcement learning to achieve human-level performance by an agent in simple single-player games with discrete states.
2.  **Objective 2** (To be completed in AP2): To use deep reinforcement learning to achieve the same performance but in more complex multi-agent games, specifically applying it to Super Mario Bros which features multiple types of enemies and dynamic environments.
3.  **Objective 3** (New): To implement and evaluate a genetic algorithm optimization layer for hyperparameter tuning of the deep reinforcement learning models, demonstrating improved convergence rates and performance metrics.
4.  **Objective 4** (New): To develop a comprehensive behavior analysis framework that can identify, categorize, and document emergent strategic behaviors in AI agents, providing insights into the learning process and decision-making patterns.
